## Inspiration
I wanted a more interactive and organized way of being able to keep track of important
events and dates going on around me, but didn't want to have to keep writing them down. With this simple Task Board, I'm able to better keep track of important things. It also was a way to better understand the implementation of third-party APIs, and the functions they provide.

## Installation
The application is ran through the browser. Once the user arrives at the web page, they can hit the Add Task button which will activate the modal where they can input their task, the date, and a description of the task. Once they hit Add Task the task is added to the To Do column. They are then able to drag and drop the task card into the In Progress and Done columns as they proceed through their task. The data is also saved through their local storage. The day.js handles the datepicker through the API.

## Example
Included in the Assets folder of the Repository is an Images folder which has a working gif image of the application and how it work through the browser.
